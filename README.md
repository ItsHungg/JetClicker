### How to download and run the application?
#### Run with a zipped file:
* First, you need to have a Python IDE installed to run the application. You can download the IDE [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/).<br>
* Then, you need to install `pip` (Python Package Installer). You can read the tutorial to download `pip` [here](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installation/).<br>
* After that, you need to install the libraries list at the bottom.<br>

Type in the command prompt:
```
pip install <library-name>
```

* After doing all the setup steps, this is how you can open and run the application file.
> 1. After downloading a `.rar` or `.zip` file, unzip and open it.
> 2. You will see a folder named **`JetClicker-...`**. Open that folder.
> 3. Open **`JetClicker.py`**. You will see the app.
> 4. Start using it and enjoy! ❤️
