### FAQ (Frequently-Asked-Questions)
#### 1. Is JetClicker safe?
> Based on the code, I can be confident that JetClicker is safe.
#### 2. Antivirus software detected JetClicker as a virus.
> JetClicker uses Inno Setup to create the installer and PyInstaller to create the `.exe` file. They are all open-source.<br>You can check it [here](https://github.com/jrsoftware/issrc) (Inno Setup) and [here](https://github.com/pyinstaller/pyinstaller) (PyInstaller). I am confident that JetClicker is completely safe and free to use.
#### 3. Which method should I use to install, zipped file or installer (not available yet)?
> I recommend you use an installer to install JetClicker because it's more convenient and you won't need to install any Python library to use.
#### 4. Does JetClicker support MacOS or Linux?
> No. JetClicker only works with Windows. Running JetClicker on another OS might get some feature break.
